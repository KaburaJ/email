Week 7 Report 
The Jitu Training Program
This week, we began learning about and implementing backend functionalities to our web apps. It was interesting to be able to create a books management API with NodeJS without a database on Monday as well as the introductory session on APIs. On Tuesday, I managed to implement user management with NodeJS and without a database. Wednesday was fun since we started collaborating in teams of three. It was interesting to connect to my database on MSSQL Server while using NodeJS and Express in VS Code. I struggled with this but finally managed to achieve it. The file folder structure session allowed my team and I to organise our code in a structured way despite having split roles. On Thursday, my team and I were able to merge our individual git branches into one, clean up the code and push it to Github. Furthermore, I was able to learn a lot during the training session on Authorization using JSON Web Tokens, Authentication using BCRYPT and Validation using Joi. Today’s assessment was manageable since it allowed me to remind myself about array and string methods. The communication skills session was informative since I got to learn from my peers’ presentations. I am currently working on implementing the Authorization, Authentication and Validation sections on my team on our own.
